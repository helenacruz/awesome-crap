I may have spent more time writing these than actually doing what they do by hand but where's the fun in that?

## tomobi.sh

Converts all the .epub files in the directory (including subdirectories) to .mobi. 
You need [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to convert them.

Usage:

```
./tomobi.sh directory-name
```

It will convert all .epub in the directory (including subdirectories).
